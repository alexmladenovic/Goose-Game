I assumed that we would have only one game so i used the singleton pattern for some classes because we need only one instance.
But that can change easily if we would like to have more that one game running at the same time.

# Compile 
>sbt compile

# Run
>sbt run

# Test Files of the project
You can test the projects function by typing 
>sbt test
